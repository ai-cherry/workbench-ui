# Repository Cleanup Report
Date: 2025-09-16

## Summary
- Files archived: 29 items (~4.6 MB) moved into `.repo_backup_20250916_082407/`
- AI/log artifacts removed: codex session logs, `.pytest_cache`, stray `.env` copies
- Documentation consolidated: new canonical `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/SETUP.md`
- Duplicated deployment config reduced to `fly.toml.frontend`
- Branch pruning and remote cleanup blocked by sandbox (index lock)

## Actions Taken
### Removed Files (archived in backup)
- Temporary/backup: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.next/package.json`, `logs/qc-scan-full.json`
- AI artifacts: `codex-review-test.md`, `codex-smoke.md`
- Duplicate docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SOPHIA_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `QUICK_START.md`
- Legacy API routes: `src/app/api/_internal/**`
- Legacy deployment config: `fly.toml`

### Consolidated Files
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `SOPHIA_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` + `QUICK_START.md` → `docs/SETUP.md`
- Backend README consolidated into pointer referencing `docs/BACKEND.md`
- Deployment configuration standardized on `fly.toml.frontend`

### Branch Cleanup
- Local branch list captured (`main`, `$TEST_BRANCH`)
- `git stash` / branch deletion / remote prune skipped: sandbox denies writes to `.git/index`

## Remaining Issues
- Existing modifications in `package.json`, `src/app/api/*`, `src/lib/server/`, and `tsconfig.json` predate this cleanup; review before committing.
- `node_modules/` and `.venv/` still consume disk space; delete after confirming dependencies can be reinstalled.
- `.repo_backup_20250916_082407/` remains inside the repo for review—move outside or remove when satisfied.

## Recommendations
1. Review and merge the outstanding API/config changes noted above to avoid carrying long-running diffs.
2. Run `git fetch --prune` / `git branch -d <merged>` manually once sandbox restrictions allow writing to `.git`.
3. Consider adding a lightweight CI task to fail on `.env` or Codex log files to prevent reintroduction.
4. After verifying backup contents, delete `.repo_backup_20250916_082407/` for a smaller working tree footprint.
