- Weaviate detection for Vector server
- Graceful error handling and status reporting

### 1.2 Comprehensive Validation
**File:** `scripts/validate_mcp_servers_enhanced.py`
- Validates all 4 servers with health/degraded/offline status
- `--allow-vector-skip` flag for environments without Weaviate
- JSON output support for automation
- Quick mode for rapid health checks

### 1.3 Shared Configuration
**File:** `environments/shared-mcp.env`
```env
# MCP Server Configuration
MCP_MEMORY_URL=http://localhost:8081
MCP_FILESYSTEM_URL=http://localhost:8082
MCP_GIT_URL=http://localhost:8084
MCP_VECTOR_URL=http://localhost:8085

# Authentication
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=dev-token
MCP_DEV_BYPASS=1
```

### 2.2 API Routes
**Health Monitoring:** `/api/mcp/health`
- Real-time status of all 4 servers
- Returns health, degraded, or offline status
- Response time metrics

**Endpoint Testing:** `/api/mcp/test`
- Validates key operations on each server
- Memory: search, store
- Filesystem: list, read
- Git: status, log
- Vector: index, search

### 2.3 Type Definitions
**File:** `src/types/mcp.ts`
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all MCP operations
- Server configuration types
- Response types for each endpoint

## 3. Validation Utilities

### 3.1 Health and Validation
- Enhanced Python validation script: `scripts/validate_mcp_servers_enhanced.py`
- Supports quick checks, verbose output, JSON mode, and optional Vector skip

---

## 4. Testing Infrastructure

### 4.1 Unified Test Script
**File:** `scripts/test-full-system.sh`
- Tests both repositories
- Validates MCP servers
- Tests API routes
- Provides clear next steps

### 4.2 Test Coverage
- Backend server health checks
- API endpoint validation
- Direct MCP endpoint testing
- Integration validation

**File:** `docs/MCP_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`
- Development setup instructions
- Production deployment guide
- Docker configuration
- Nginx reverse proxy setup
- Health monitoring with Prometheus
- Troubleshooting guide
- Rollback procedures

### 5.2 Architecture Documentation
