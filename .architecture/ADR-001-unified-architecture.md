# ADR-001: Unified System Architecture for Sophia Intel AI

## Status
**Accepted** - Implemented

## Context
Sophia Intel AI started as a collection of independent MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers operating in isolation. This created several challenges:
- No central orchestration or coordination
- Inconsistent service contracts and APIs
- Difficult deployment and management
- Limited monitoring and observability
- No unified error handling or resilience patterns

## Decision
We will establish Sophia Intel AI as a **unified, centrally orchestrated system** where:
1. All MCP servers function as core infrastructure components
2. Services follow standardized contracts and interfaces
3. A central registry manages service lifecycle and dependencies
4. Unified configuration management across all environments
5. Comprehensive monitoring and health checking
6. Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries) built into the core

## Architecture Components

### 1. Service Contracts (`src/core/service-contracts/`)
- **Base Service Interface**: Common contract all services must implement
- **Specialized Interfaces**: Memory, Filesystem, Git, Vector services
- **Standardized Methods**: initialize(), connect(), disconnect(), health(), getMetrics()
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces with strict typing

### 2. Service Registry (`src/core/service-registry.ts`)
- **Central Management**: Single source of truth for all services
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic ordering based on dependencies
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with state tracking
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic lookup by type or ID

### 3. Unified Configuration (`config/`)
- **Master Config**: `sophia.config.yaml` with all system settings
- **Environment Profiles**: dev.yaml, staging.yaml, prod.yaml
- **Hierarchical Override**: Environment-specific settings override defaults
- **Hot Reload Support**: Configuration changes without restart

### 4. Unified Startup (`scripts/unified-startup.sh`)
- **Orchestrated Launch**: Services start in dependency order
- **Health Validation**: Each service must be healthy before proceeding
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Reverse order shutdown with cleanup
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic restart with exponential backoff

### 5. Monitoring Dashboard (`src/components/monitoring/health-dashboard.tsx`)
- **Real-time Status**: Live health status of all services
- **Metrics Visualization**: Performance metrics and trends
- **Alert Management**: Critical alerts with severity levels
- **Service Control**: Start/stop/restart individual services

### 6. Resilience Patterns (`src/core/circuit-breaker.ts`)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Exponential Backoff**: Smart retry logic
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation
- **Timeout Management**: Request-level timeouts

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Unified Management**: Single point of control for entire system
- **Improved Reliability**: Built-in resilience and error handling
- **Better Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and metrics
- **Easier Deployment**: One command to start/stop everything
- **Consistent APIs**: Standardized interfaces across all services
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with compile-time checking
- **Scalability**: Ready for horizontal scaling and clustering

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: More abstraction layers
- **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand the unified architecture
- **Tight Coupling**: Services depend on central registry
- **Single Point of Failure**: Registry becomes critical component

### Mitigations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive architecture documentation
- **Fallback Mode**: Services can operate independently if needed
- **Registry Redundancy**: Can be made highly available
- **Gradual Migration**: Existing services can be migrated incrementally

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Service contracts for all MCP servers
